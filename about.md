    <h1>Spencer's About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Spencer.  After years of working for a food manufacturer and then a chemical equipment supplier, I became disinterested in process engineering converted to web development, that I find much more interesting and rewarding.  I am presently working for the world's largest company, developing their photos website.</p>
    <h1>Academic</h1>
    <p>After studying pure mathematics with statistics, chemistry and biology at A level I went on to study Chemical and Bioprocess Engineering at the  University of Surrey.</p>
    <p>I then took Web Development Immersive at General Assembly, London and converted to being a web developer.</p>
    <h1>Interests</h1>
    <p>I enjoy running, training frequently with my running club(s) and compete in my local parkrun, local 10ks, 10 miles, 1/2 marathons and marathons.  I am creating some "technology" projects with some friends.  I have learnt French to a proficient level and basic German, both in my own time by self study and attending evening classes.</p>
