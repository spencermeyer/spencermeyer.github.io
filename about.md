    <h1>Spencer's About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Spencer.  After years of working for a food manufacturer and then a chemical equipment supplier, I'm now working as a process engineer with a project engineering company.  Although the work has been interesting at times, I am growing disinterested in process engineering and am looking for something more interesting and rewarding to do.</p>
    <h1>Academic</h1>
    <p>After studying pure mathematics with statistics, chemistry and biology at A level I went on to study Chemical and Bioprocess Engineering at the  University of Surrey.</p>
    <h1>Interests</h1>
    <p>I enjoy running, training frequently with my running club(s) and compete in my local parkrun, local 10ks, 10 miles, 1/2 marathons and marathons.  I am creating some "technology" projects with some friends.  I have learnt French to a proficient level and basic German, both in my own time by self study and attending evening classes.</p>
