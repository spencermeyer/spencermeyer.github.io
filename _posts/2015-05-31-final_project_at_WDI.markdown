My final project at WDI is a PacMan game.  This is based on Ruby on Rails and extensively used Javascript and Javascript's Canvas.  There is a link on the left to the project.  There are over 500 lines of custom vanilla Javascript in this project.  It uses a unique way for the pacman to navigate the maze, as it uses forward looking to detect a wall rather than hard coding.  This means that new mazes could be implemented much more easily than in conventional methods.
