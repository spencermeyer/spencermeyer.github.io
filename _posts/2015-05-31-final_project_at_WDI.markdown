My final project at WDI is a PacMan game.  This is based on Ruby on Rails and extensively used Javascript and Javascript's Canvas.  There is a link on the right to the projct, but it is still very much in the development phase at the time of writing.  Hopefully by June 5th when I am due to present it, it will be finished.
