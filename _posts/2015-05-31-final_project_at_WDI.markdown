My final project at WDI is a PacMan game.  This is based on Ruby on Rails and extensively used Javascript and Javascript's Canvas.  There is a link on the left to the project, but it unfortunately does not work very well Heroku (cannot load assets of images, sounds, fonts etc) although it works really well on localhost!
