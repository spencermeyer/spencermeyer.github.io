Towards the end of our WDI, we did a 24 hour "hackathon".  We were given the freedom to do whatever ee liked, and I did a simple pacman experiment mainly using javascript to listen to keystrokes and manipulate the css of objects positions accordingly.  The javascript actually swaps the images of the pacman rather than rotates them.  This gave me the idea for my final project where I created a much more sophisticated pacman game.
