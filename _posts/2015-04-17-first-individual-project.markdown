My first individual project at General Assembly London on the Web development immersive program was a "noughts and crosses" / "tick tack toe" game.  This ran on Ruby on Rails where the data was stored in a sql database.  My best achievement was to write custom code to find a line of noughts or crosses in the game.  The code can be seen in my github repository.
