I wanted to pratice some AJAX techniques and set up a Node application.  This application retrieves live bus data from TFL (Transport For London) and constructs a customised selector list depending upon which bus route you have chosen.  Then it selects buses depending upon which bus stop you choose, and AJAXes the data into the view.
