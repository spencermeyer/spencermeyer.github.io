First Web Project with General Assembly London was a General Assembly Ideas Website which I worked on as part of a team with Filippo and Dani.  You can find it here: https://protected-wildwood-2099.herokuapp.com/  although it does not work as well on Heroku as it does on localhost.  It is a rails app that uses devise, ransack, stripe, and much more.
