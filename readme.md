Hi, this is my blog post website. Spencer.




I have deleted the link to the RSS feed as this is not wanted.  If I want to put it back, insert:
<li class="active"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml">RSS</a></li>
into the header.html file.



My final project at WDI is a PacMan game.  This is based on Ruby on Rails and extensively used Javascript and Javascript's Canvas.
