Hi, this is my blog post website. Spencer.

It is created from a modified Jekyll template and my intention is to list my projects.




<!-- I have deleted the link to the RSS feed as this is not wanted.  If I want to put it back, insert:
<li class="active"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml">RSS</a></li>
into the header.html file. -->
