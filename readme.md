Hi, this is my blog post website.

This shows the progression of my projects since I converted to being a web developer in 2015.

It is created from a modified Jekyll template and I list and summarise my hobby development projects that I work on in my spare time.  At work I work on the photos website for the worlds largest company.

To run this locally, `bundle exec jekyll serve`
